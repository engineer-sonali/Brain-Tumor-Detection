# Brain-Tumor-Detection
The emerging field in many medical diagnostic applications is automated flaw detection in medical imaging. Automated tumor diagnosis in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is extremely essential since it provides details about aberrant tissues that are required for treatment planning. Human inspection is the standard procedure for flaw detection in magnetic resonance brain pictures. Using this strategy with a lot of data is not practicable. Therefore, automated tumor detection techniques are created because they would free up radiologist time. The complexity and variety of tumors make it difficult to accurately detect brain cancers with an MRI. In this study, deep learning techniques are used to find tumors in brain MRIs.
